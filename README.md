**🎧 Spotify Data Analysis – My Second Exciting Experience with Power BI! 🚀**  

This time, I worked with a **Spotify dataset** that I downloaded and decided to analyze using **Power BI**.  
My goal was to see how I could leverage this powerful tool to **analyze music data**.  

This was my **second experience** with Power BI, and I have to say—it made the process **super easy!** 😍

### 🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation  

Before diving into the analysis, I prepared the data using **Python (pandas & numpy)** to make it cleaner and easier to work with.  

✨ **Here’s what I did:**  

🔹 **Removed unnecessary columns**  
Columns like `spotify_track_url` and `shuffle` were not useful, so I dropped them.  

🔸 **Removed duplicate records**  
Used `drop_duplicates` to clean up the dataset.  

🔹 **Handled missing values**  
Dropped all missing values using `dropna`.  

🔸 **Renamed columns**  
Modified column names for better readability.  

🔹 **Converted date format**  
Ensured the date column was in the correct format for better visualization.  

After these steps, I had a **clean dataset** ready to be loaded into Power BI.
